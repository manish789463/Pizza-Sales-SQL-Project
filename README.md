🚀 Excited to share my latest project on pizza sales analytics! 🍕📊

Over the past few weeks, I have been working on a comprehensive SQL project where I analyzed sales data for a pizza chain. This project involved:

Designing and optimizing database schemas.
Writing complex SQL queries to extract meaningful insights.
Creating visualizations to illustrate trends and patterns in sales data.
Key highlights include:

Data Cleaning and Preparation: Ensured data quality for accurate analysis.
Sales Trends Analysis: Identified peak sales periods and customer preferences.
Performance Metrics: Analyzed key performance indicators to drive business decisions.
This project not only enhanced my SQL skills but also deepened my understanding of data analytics and business intelligence.

Looking forward to leveraging these skills in future opportunities! 🚀
